NMR Models – Organic Materials
==============================

Benchmarks for machine-learned **NMR chemical-shielding models** of molecular
organic crystals. These models predict shieldings rather than energies and forces,
so this category is scored separately from the interatomic-potential categories and
does not contribute to the overall summary score.

The models are compared with experimental chemical shifts rather than with DFT,
because they are trained on different DFT references; a DFT reference would mostly
measure that intended difference. Experimental values are taken from the original
assignment papers and mapped atom by atom onto the structures. Where the literature
leaves an assignment ambiguous, it is resolved once against the GIPAW-PBE shieldings
and used identically for every model, so no model can pick its own most favourable
assignment.


NMR Isotropic Shifts
====================

Summary
-------

Performance in predicting isotropic ¹H, ¹³C and ¹⁵N chemical shifts of 49 molecular
crystals, compared with experiment. ShiftML3 is trained on periodic GIPAW-PBE
shieldings; ShiftML4 is trained on GIPAW-PBE shieldings plus a PBE0 molecular
correction.


Metrics
-------

The models predict shieldings :math:`\sigma`, which are converted to shifts with one
straight line per nucleus and model, fitted by weighted least squares over all sites of
all structures:

.. math::

   (a, b) = \arg\min_{a,\,b} \sum_i w_i \left(\delta^{\mathrm{exp}}_i - a\,\sigma_i - b\right)^2

where :math:`\delta^{\mathrm{exp}}_i` is the experimental shift of site
:math:`i`, :math:`\sigma_i` its predicted shielding, averaged over its atoms and their
symmetry copies in the cell, and :math:`w_i` its weight. The slope :math:`a` is fitted
rather than fixed at −1. The predicted shifts are then

.. math::

   \delta_i = a\,\sigma_i + b

The weight :math:`w_i` is the number of protons a ¹H site represents: protons that
exchange quickly on one atom and share one reported shift, such as those of a methyl
group, form one site of weight 3. All other sites, including all ¹³C and ¹⁵N sites, have
weight 1. Because the line is fitted to the same experimental shifts that the errors
below are measured on, the errors are slightly lower than they would be for new
structures (by under 1% for ¹H and ¹³C, and about 3% for ¹⁵N).

1. Isotropic shift Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (¹H, ¹³C, ¹⁵N)

   The root-mean-square difference between predicted and experimental shifts, for
   each nucleus:

   .. math::

      \mathrm{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_i w_i \left(\delta^{\mathrm{exp}}_i - \delta_i\right)^2}{\sum_i w_i}}

2. Isotropic shift Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (¹H, ¹³C, ¹⁵N)

   The weighted mean absolute difference about the same line,

   .. math::

      \mathrm{MAE} = \frac{\sum_i w_i \left|\delta^{\mathrm{exp}}_i - \delta_i\right|}{\sum_i w_i}

   It is less influenced than the RMSE by a few large errors.

NMR Shift Tensors
=================

Summary
-------

Performance in predicting the principal components of the ¹³C chemical-shift tensor for
118 carbon sites in 19 molecular crystals, compared with experiment. These are the
structures used in the ShiftML papers' tensor benchmark.


Metrics
-------

1. ¹³C tensor Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
2. ¹³C tensor Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

As for isotropic shifts, but over the three principal components of each carbon's
tensor. Each predicted shielding tensor is symmetrised and diagonalised, and its
eigenvalues :math:`\sigma_{11} \le \sigma_{22} \le \sigma_{33}` are paired with the
experimental :math:`\delta_{11} \ge \delta_{22} \ge \delta_{33}`. One unweighted line
:math:`\delta = a\,\sigma + b` per model is fitted through all three components of all
sites, and the RMSE and MAE are taken over all components.

Structure Identification - Cocaine
==================================

Summary
-------

Identifying the correct crystal structure of cocaine among 29 candidate structures from
crystal structure prediction, by comparing predicted and experimental ¹H shifts,
following the atomistic-cookbook recipe on NMR crystallography with ShiftML3. The
correct structure is the prediction that matches the X-ray structure. It covers a
single crystal, so it does not count towards the category score.


Metrics
-------

1. Identification margin

For each candidate, the ¹H shieldings of one molecule are grouped into the 17 assigned
sites (the recipe's "environments") and converted to shifts with the slope fixed at −1
and an intercept fitted per candidate, and the RMSE against experiment is computed. The
margin is the RMSE of the best wrong candidate minus that of the correct structure;
higher is better, and zero or below means the correct structure is not identified. The
rank of the correct structure and its RMSE are also shown, for information.
